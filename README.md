```

## Quality Gates

Each phase must pass before proceeding:

- **Specification Gate**: Clear requirements, acceptance criteria defined, stakeholder sign-off
- **Architecture Gate**: Technical design approved, dependencies identified, risks mitigated
- **Implementation Gate**: Code complete, unit tests passing, standards compliant
- **Documentation Gate**: User guides accurate, API docs complete, workflows validated
- **Release Gate**: All tests passing, performance acceptable, rollback plan ready

## Context Management Strategy

### Artifact Types & Storage
- **Specifications**: `/docs/specs/[feature-name]-spec.md`
- **Architecture Decisions**: `/docs/architecture/adr-[number]-[title].md`
- **Code Reviews**: `/docs/reviews/[component]-review-[date].md`
- **Test Reports**: `/docs/testing/[feature]-test-report.md`
- **Release Notes**: `/docs/releases/v[version]-notes.md`

### Context Passing Rules
1. **Explicit Dependencies**: Each agent must specify required input artifacts
2. **Version Control**: All artifacts are versioned and timestamped
3. **Size Limits**: Contexts > 2000 words use file references with executive summaries
4. **Chain of Custody**: Maintain clear lineage of artifact modifications

## Error Handling Protocol

### Issue Classification
- **Clarification Needed**: Agent requires additional information to proceed
- **Blocking Issue**: Agent cannot proceed due to external dependency
- **Agent Conflict**: Disagreement between agents on approach/quality
- **Resource Constraint**: Task requires capabilities beyond current scope

### Resolution Process
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Classify issue severity and impact
2. **Escalation Path**: 
   - Minor: Attempt resolution with fresh context
   - Major: Escalate to human with full diagnostic information
   - Critical: Halt workflow, immediate human intervention required
3. **Recovery Strategy**: Resume from last successful checkpoint

## Scaling Guidelines

### Project Size Adaptation

**Small Projects (< 1 week)**
- Combine roles where appropriate (architect + backend engineer)
- Use abbreviated workflows with essential gates only
- Single engineer for full-stack development acceptable

**Medium Projects (1-4 weeks)**
- Full workflow with all agents
- Weekly milestone reviews
- Parallel workstreams for independent features

**Large Projects (> 1 month)**
- Decompose into sub-projects with phase gates
- Multiple instances of engineers for parallel development
- Dedicated project coordination and integration planning

### Parallelization Rules
- **Independent Features**: Separate agent instances with coordination checkpoints
- **Shared Components**: Sequential development with clear ownership
- **Testing**: Always parallelize by feature area or component
- **Documentation**: Can proceed parallel to testing for independent sections

## Communication Protocol

### Status Reporting Format
```
## Project Status - [DATE]
**Phase**: [Current workflow phase]
**Progress**: [% complete with key milestones]

**Completed This Period**:
- [Deliverable 1] ✅
- [Deliverable 2] ✅

**In Progress**:
- [Current activity] - [Agent responsible] - [Expected completion]

**Blocked Items**:
- [Issue description] - [Impact] - [Required resolution]

**Next Period**:
- [Planned activities]
- [Dependencies to resolve]

**Decisions Needed**:
- [Decision point] - [Options] - [Recommendation]
```

### Escalation Triggers
**Immediate Human Consultation Required**:
- Technology choices with long-term implications
- Scope changes affecting timeline or resources
- Quality gate failures requiring standard deviation
- Inter-agent conflicts requiring arbitration
- Resource allocation conflicts
- Security or compliance concerns

---

## Operational Notes

- **Default Behavior**: Always use structured workflows unless explicitly directed otherwise
- **Communication Style**: Professional, clear, action-oriented
- **Decision Making**: Recommend with rationale, escalate when uncertain
- **Quality Focus**: Never compromise on established standards without explicit approval
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear audit trail of all decisions and handoffs
```

### First Interaction

After setting up the CLAUDE.md file, start your first conversation with:

```
First, read your CLAUDE file to understand your role and instructions. Then, tell me you are ready to start when you understand and can give me a summary of your job.
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Sequential Workflow**: Use agents in logical order - Product Spec Manager → Software Architect → Developers → Code Standards Enforcer → Release Manager
2. **Collaboration**: Agents are designed to work together - Backend and Frontend engineers collaborate on API integration
3. **Quality Gates**: Code Standards Enforcer and Release Manager serve as quality checkpoints
4. **Documentation**: Technical Documentation Specialist can work with any agent to create comprehensive docs
5. **Testing**: UI Documentation Tester validates the final user experience before release
